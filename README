WHAT IS IN THIS UPDATE:
- SUPPORT FOR: enums
- SUPPORT FOR: static imports
- SUPPORT FOR: ehanced for
- SUPPORT FOR: generics

AGGREGATION VS. NORMAL
SAME: 
Both version support java 1.5

DIFFERENCE:
The old starUML-java used to create an assosication between classes 
for member variables. This behavior has been left the same for the 
NORMAL version. The AGGREGATION version creates aggregation relationships
between classes rather than just directed association as it should be the
case for java.

INSTALLATION:

AGGREGATION
1- Go to: .\Aggregation_staruml-java\staruml-java\deploy.
2- Copy staruml-java
3- Find your installation directory for StarUML. (In My case D:\Program Files\StarUML\)
4- Go to: \modules and replace your staruml-java folder.
5- Start StarUML.

NORMAL
1- Go to: .\Normal_staruml-java\staruml-java\deploy.
2- Copy staruml-java
3- Find your installation directory for StarUML. (In My case D:\Program Files\StarUML\)
4- Go to: \modules and replace your staruml-java folder.
5- Start StarUML.

NOTE: The only files that are actually required for this to work are JavaAddIn.dll,
	  JavaParser.dll and java.GMR. So, if you would rather just copy those files
	  more power to you.

SOURCE:
The source code for both version is also included with this release. The source code
can be found inside the \staruml-java\src folder of each version.

UPDATE:
09/21/2011		Fixed the issue of "Grammar Not Loaded". I great special thanks go
				to Norm Wilson from ProGrammar for all his help.
03/12/2012		Added support for semicolon on the enum declaration for internal items. 
				Added Support for array type on the generics. As of this version
				the enums are generated as nested class under the declaring class.
				Aggregation version of module will be deprecrated unless there is 
				interest to keep it alive (Send your feedback).
