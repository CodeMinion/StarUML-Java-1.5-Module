This version supports Java 1.5 syntax.","body":"#UPDATE FOR STARUML - JAVA MODULE\r\n##SUPPORT FOR JAVA 1.5 ADDED\r\n\r\n**AUTHOR:** Frank E. Hernandez\r\n\r\n**A.K.A:** CODE MINION\r\n\r\n**DATE:** July 31, 2011\r\n\r\n###WHAT IS IN THIS UPDATE:\r\n- SUPPORT FOR: enums\r\n- SUPPORT FOR: static imports\r\n- SUPPORT FOR: ehanced for\r\n- SUPPORT FOR: generics\r\n\r\n###AGGREGATION VS. NORMAL\r\nSAME: \r\nBoth version support java 1.5\r\n\r\n###DIFFERENCE:\r\nThe old starUML-java used to create an assosication between classes for member variables. This behavior has been left the same for the NORMAL version. The AGGREGATION version creates aggregation relationships between classes rather than just directed association as it should be the case for java.\r\n\r\n###INSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n###AGGREGATION\r\n1- Go to: .\\Aggregation_staruml-java\\staruml-java\\deploy.\r\n\r\n2- Copy staruml-java\r\n\r\n3- Find your installation directory for StarUML. (In My case D:\\Program Files\\StarUML\\)\r\n\r\n4- Go to: \\modules and replace your staruml-java folder.\r\n\r\n5- Start StarUML.\r\n\r\n###NORMAL\r\n1- Go to: .\\Normal_staruml-java\\staruml-java\\deploy.\r\n\r\n2- Copy staruml-java\r\n\r\n3- Find your installation directory for StarUML. (In My case D:\\Program Files\\StarUML\\)\r\n\r\n4- Go to: \\modules and replace your staruml-java folder.\r\n\r\n5- Start StarUML.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The only files that are actually required for this to work are JavaAddIn.dll, JavaParser.dll and java.GMR. So, if you would rather just copy those files more power to you.\r\n\r\n###SOURCE:\r\nThe source code for both version is also included with this release. The source code can be found inside the \\staruml-java\\src folder of each version.\r\n\r\n###UPDATE:\r\n\r\n**09/21/2011**\t\tFixed the issue of \"Grammar Not Loaded\". I great special thanks go to Norm Wilson from ProGrammar for all his help.\r\n\r\n**03/12/2012**\t\tAdded support for semicolon on the enum declaration for internal items. Added Support for array type on the generics. As of this version the enums are generated as nested class under the declaring class. Aggregation version of module will be deprecrated unless there is interest to keep it alive (Send your feedback).\r\n\r\n**03/13/2012**\t\tAdded some corrections to the grammar. Centrilized the code on ModuleMainCode. Had too much of a mess of code with multiple versions. \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
